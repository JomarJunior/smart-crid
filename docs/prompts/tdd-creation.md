You are a senior software engineer and technical architect working on an academic project. I need you to generate a full, well-organized, and visually pleasant **Technical Design Document (TDD)** following modern software engineering standards.

🎯 **Project Summary:**
The project consists of a **smart contract written in Solidity** that represents a **CRID (Certificate of Enrollment Request for Courses)**. This is part of a university assignment for the **Advanced Programming** course.

🧑‍🏫 **Professor's Requirements:**

- Develop a smart contract based on “Example 3 of Solidity” shown in class
- Apply clean software engineering practices
- Use **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Create a working **CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI)
- Deliver a final **PDF report in IEEE format using LaTeX**
- The team can have up to 3 students

📄 **TDD Structure (please follow this outline and enrich as needed):**

1. 🔍 Project Overview
2. 🎯 Objectives (Functional & Non-Functional Requirements)
3. 🔐 Security Considerations (threats, mitigation, access control with modifiers, etc.)
4. 📚 Domain Definition with Ubiquitous Language Glossary
5. 🧩 Architecture and Bounded Contexts (e.g., Student, Coordination, Blockchain, Security, Interface)
6. 🛠️ Tools and Technologies (Solidity, Hardhat, Mocha/Chai, solhint, GitHub Actions, etc.)
7. 🗂️ Project Directory Structure
8. 📆 Next Steps / Milestones
9. 📎 Appendices (Requirements doc, Security doc, Diagrams, etc.)

📌 **Instructions:**

- Use a clean and professional tone, but make it visually engaging
- Add relevant emojis (🎯, 🧩, 🛠️, 🔐, 📎, etc.) at section headers, bullet points, or where they help comprehension
- Use markdown-like formatting: titles, bold, italics, bullet lists, and tables to make the structure pleasant to read
- Do not include code samples — focus on conceptual design
- Make justified technical decisions where needed, following best practices in smart contract architecture and security

Generate the full document accordingly. Assume the reader is technically literate but not necessarily blockchain-expert.
